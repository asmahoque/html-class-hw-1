    <h1><b> Can carbon removal help meet world's climate targets?</b></h1>
    <b>Author name:</b> <i><u><b>Daniel</b></u></i>
    <p>To prevent further global heating, humans need to stop burning fossil fuels. But that's not enough -- experts now say we also need to remove billions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. What are our options?</p>

    <p>"It isn't either/or," said Jan Minx of the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin, and one of the authors of a new global overview of carbon dioxide removal projects, released Thursday.</p> <hr><a target="__blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100025376136939&mibextid=ZbWKwL">facebook</a> <a href="https://creativeitinstitutectg.com/"target='__blank'>cit</a>

<p>Governments around the world will need to rely on widespread deployment of established and future carbon removal technology to achieve net-zero targets by mid-century, said Minx. They will also need redouble efforts in the following decades to bring atmospheric CO2 back to climate-safe levels.</p>
<p>By 2100, carbon dioxide removal technology will need to extract between 450 billion and 1.1 trillion metric tons of CO2 — depending on how quickly we cut emissions over the next few decades, said the report.

    "Innovation takes time, upscaling takes time, and if we don't start building these plants now and develop policy plans accordingly, then we won't get there," said Minx.</p>
    <p>But few governments have included carbon removal projects as part of their plans to hit emissions targets, even though advances in the field have been picking up speed over the last decade, said the report, which is the first to focus on carbon removal efforts worldwide.'Next decade is crucial' for carbon removal tech

        Since 1990, we have emitted more than 924 billion metric ton of CO2 equivalent into the planet's atmosphere — more than 37 billion in 2021 alone — largely from burning climate-wrecking fossil fuels. That's more CO2 emitted in three decades than in all human history before that time.
        
        Nearly all the world's current carbon dioxide removal — estimated at roughly 2 billion metric tons of emissions yearly — is achieved using conventional methods on managed land. This includes established methods like peatland and wetland restoration, reforestation and fixing carbon in croplands and grasslands.</p>
